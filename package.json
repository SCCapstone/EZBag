  "description": "Scan-and-go is a form of self-checkout which has recently been growing in popularity with big-box stores.  However, custom software is expensive and smaller retailers do not have the budget to develop their own custom scan-and-go solution. Therefore, EZBag is a free web app that aims to allow any brick-and-mortar store to implement scan-and-go.  A patron at a participating store can use the EZBag web app on their phone to scan and pay for items without going through the typical checkout process. [EZBag web app view mockups can be found here.](https://github.com/SCCapstone/EZBag/wiki/Requirements)",
